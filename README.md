## Are you really productive?
When you go to sleep, do you feel accomplished? Like seriously, think about it. We all strive to become more productive but can never perfect this key skill for success! A main contributor to this is procrastination; we have all done it. With remote work and school taking place online, it becomes easier for people to procrastinate, especially when no one is checking on them.

It is clear that productivity is based on habits, and procrastination is a bad habit. But how do we solve procrastination? Sure, we can try and set artificial deadlines, but you already know what is going to happen. You stick to these for a couple of days and then it's back to the beginning. Why is this?

## Why self-set deadlines do not work
Two reasons: for humans to stick to deadlines, they need reward or threat. At school, this threat is failing the course, detention, etc. This is why we are always much more successful with completing school tasks. Another reason is the lack of motivation; we have nobody to review our work and keep us on track—this is basic psychology. But how do we solve these problems?

## The solution? COMMIT!

COMMIT is a peer-based productivity app dedicated to helping you stay committed and motivated to achieve your goals. To use COMMIT, you write your daily goals when you wake up and add them to the todo list. Then, when you have completed them, simply upload a photo of your achieved task!

COMMIT is more than a todo list. We solve the two major problems stopping you from being productive. The first new concept is our proof of work community approach. Add friends and get notified when they complete a task, similar to a classroom. You can then validate each other's photos to check if the proposed task is completed—a proof of work system. We have also added a threat (optional), something to push you to complete your goals. This is done through money. Assign a value to each goal, and if you fail to meet this goal, you pay the proposed fine. Once you COMMIT to it, there's no backing out!

We know the biggest hurdle to finishing tasks is starting them. We hope this way can bring you one step closer to your goals. No excuse to procrastinate!

## Features:
- Write daily goals and add them to the todo list
- Upload a photo of your achieved task
- Proof of work community approach: add friends and validate each other's tasks
- Optional monetary threat to encourage goal completion

## How I built it
The app was built using Flutter with the database on Firebase. The entire UI/UX was designed on Figma.

## Challenges I ran into
The biggest challenge was routing all the screens in the app.

## Accomplishments
As a team, we knew coordination would be a challenge as we are an international team from three different continents and hence, three extremely different time zones. We stepped up to the challenge and made it work by delegating tasks of equal work to each person. We managed to lower the workload while keeping good communication, despite being up to seven hours apart.

## What I learned
I learned Flutter, Firebase, and image upload using buckets, which was a significant learning curve within 48 hours. It was great to gain these skills and successfully complete the project.

## What's next for COMMIT
Thank you for your enthusiasm! We hope to launch the app soon in the Play Store and Apple Store. Stay tuned!
